**BioMID** simply checks to see whether there is, in fact, a person in a certain photograph or video. It uses machine learning algorithms to scan digital images for human faces, typically by looking for the eyes first and then calculating the edges of each human face. This is how the system pinpoints exactly where human faces are and counts how many people are present in a photo or video.

# How it Works?
""")
st.write("""
**Face recognition technology** is one use of face detection. Where face detection simply identifies the presence of a face in an image, face recognition either verifies or identifies an actual person.

Once a system establishes that there is, in fact, a face present, it uses a series of algorithms to examine that face. The algorithms rely on specific details, such as:
\n
üîØ **How far apart are the eyes?**\n
üîØ **How high is the bridge of the nose?**\n
These details are known as ‚Äúfacial landmarks,‚Äù and the more landmarks a face recognition system can read, the more accurate the system will be. Those landmarks are used to create a precise mathematical representation of the face.
At this point, face recognition runs the face ‚Äì- or rather, the mathematical representation of it ‚Äî against an existing database of faces to find a match and identify the person in the picture.
